Install packages using the "pipenv install" command to
ensure compatible packages are installed (though this was
a post-hoc use of pipenv, so mistakes may exist)

For some of the plotting functions, a working LaTeX
installation is also required. In addition, the cm-super
and dvipng packages are required for Linux platforms - I'm
afraid I don't know what the equivalent installation
requirements are for non-Linux OS.
